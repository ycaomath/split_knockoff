This is the package for split Knockoffs. The main content of this package is the following two functions:

1. split_knockoffs.filter(X, D, y, nu_s, option); the split Knockoff filter, details will be explained later
2. split_knockoffs.cv_filter(X, D, y, nu_s, option); the split Knockoff filter with cross validation, details will be explained later.

To reproduce the figures and tables in the paper, please go to "simulation" folder and "AD_experiments" folder and run the respective file. The recommended setting for the range of lambda is 10^0 - 10^-6. Before using this package, please add the folder to path by changing the "addpath('C:\Users\Yang\desktop\Split_Knockoffs');" in each document.



Usage of functions:

[results, Z, t_Z] = split_knockoffs.filter(X, D, y, nu_s, option): split Knockoff filter for structural sparsity problem.

input argument

nu: the parameter for variable splitting
option: options for creating the Knockoff statistics
	option.eta : the choice of eta for creating the knockoff copy
	option.q: the desired FDR control bound
	option.method: "knockoff" or "knockoff+"
	option.stage0: choose the method to conduct split knockoff
		"fixed": fixed intercept assignment for PATH ORDER method
			option.beta : the choice of fixed beta for step 0:
